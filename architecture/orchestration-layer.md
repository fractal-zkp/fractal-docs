# Orchestration Layer

The orchestration layer plays a pivotal role in managing and coordinating network resources, specifically sequencers and provers, to support the deployment and operation of rollups. When a request for rollup deployment is received by the orchestration layer, it initiates an evaluation of the sequencer and prover pools.

During this evaluation process, the orchestration layer identifies and selects suitable candidates from the pools to fulfil the operational requirements of the rollup being deployed. This involves considering factors such as resource availability, performance history, and network demand to ensure optimal assignment of resources.

Furthermore, the orchestration layer is tasked with incentivizing sequencers and provers to effectively carry out their designated duties. Incentives are in the form of token rewards for timely and accurate sequencing and proof generation, as well as penalties for instances of malicious behaviour or subpar performance. These incentives are essential for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the Fractal ecosystem, encouraging participants to uphold their responsibilities and contribute positively to the network.
