# Prover Layer

Rollups deployed on Fractal rely on provers to generate zero-knowledge proofs, attesting to the integrity of transactions and blocks of the rollup. However, the process of generating these proofs can be resource-intensive, presenting a significant barrier to entry for rollup deployment.

Recognizing this challenge, Fractal offers a solution by providing a decentralized pool of provers. This pool serves as a valuable resource that rollup operators can access to streamline the deployment process. Instead of grappling with the resource demands and complexities of sourcing and managing provers independently, rollup operators can leverage Fractal's pool of provers, effectively reducing barriers to entry and simplifying the deployment process.

Upon deploying a rollup on the Fractal, provers will be automatically assigned, by the [orchestration-layer.md](orchestration-layer.md "mention"), from the pool to their respective rollups. This streamlined approach ensures that rollups have access to the necessary provers without the need for extensive setup or resource allocation efforts.

By offering access to a decentralized pool of provers, Fractal empowers rollup operators to overcome resource constraints and focus their efforts on innovating and expanding their rollups.
