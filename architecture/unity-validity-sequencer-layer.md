# Unity - Validity Sequencer Layer

Rollups deployed on the Fractal rely on sequencers to effectively sequence / execute transactions and produce blocks. These sequencers play a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of rollup networks, but the process of building and managing a sequencer set can pose significant challenges for rollup operators.

Recognizing this challenge, Fractal offers a solution by providing a decentralized pool of sequencers. This pool serves as a readily available resource that rollup operators can tap into to streamline their sequencing operations. Instead of having to navigate the complexities of sourcing and managing sequencers independently, rollup operators can leverage Fractal's pool of sequencers, reducing the barrier to entry and simplifying the sequencing process.

Through Fractal's platform, rollup operators have the flexibility to select the number of sequencers they require for their specific needs. Once chosen, these sequencers are seamlessly assigned from the pool to the respective rollup, ensuring efficient and reliable sequencing without the need for extensive setup or maintenance efforts.

Fractal further innovates within this space by introducing Unity, our advanced shared validity sequencer. Unity addresses a paramount challenge in sharded rollup architecturesâ€”enabling atomic cross-rollup composability. This pioneering feature allows for transactions to be executed across different rollup networks atomically, fostering seamless interactions between separate rollups. Unity's integration enhances the operational efficiency and scalability of the ecosystem and empowers developers to create more complex and interconnected decentralized applications. By harnessing the power of Unity, rollup operators on the Fractal platform can now achieve unprecedented levels of interoperability, thereby simplifying the user experience and broadening the spectrum of possible decentralized applications.

By offering access to a decentralized pool of sequencers, and with the advent of Unity, Fractal empowers rollup operators to focus their efforts on innovating and growing their rollups. This strategic approach alleviates the burdens associated with sequencer management and paves the way for a more integrated, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized future.
