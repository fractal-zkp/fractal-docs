# Aggregation Layer

The aggregation layer serves a critical role in optimizing the settlement process and enhancing interoperability between rollups deployed on the platform. This layer is tasked with recursively aggregating proofs generated by the various rollups, all while facilitating seamless cross-rollup interoperability without the need for direct messaging via the settlement layer.

We are currently exploring an integration with Polygon's Agg layer to serve as the aggregation layer for Fractal. You can read more about Polygon's Agg layer in their blog [here](https://polygon.technology/blog/aggregated-blockchains-a-new-thesis).

At its core, the aggregation layer sources and aggregate zero-knowledge proofs associated with rollup blocks. One of the most significant advantages of the aggregation layer's functionality lies in its ability to achieve substantial economic savings during the settlement process, particularly when settling to the Ethereum blockchain. In addition the aggregation layer also offers safety gurantees for cross-rollup transactions.

Moreover, the aggregation layer's capabilities offer scalable economic benefits that grow in tandem with the expansion of the Fractal network. As more rollups join the ecosystem, the aggregation layer's efficiency improves, leading to a reduction in settlement costs per rollup. This economic scalability underscores the value proposition of the Fractal platform, making it an attractive and cost-effective solution for decentralized rollups.

The aggregation layer plays a vital role in enhancing cross-rollup interoperability within the Fractal ecosystem. By aggregating zero-knowledge proofs from various rollups, it enables seamless communication and data exchange between different networks without relying on direct messaging through the settlement layer. This interoperability empowers users and dApps to interact fluidly across multiple rollups, facilitating asset transfers, accessing liquidity pools, and executing complex smart contracts across rollups.
