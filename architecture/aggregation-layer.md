# Aggregation Layer

The aggregation layer serves a critical role in optimizing the settlement process and enhancing interoperability between rollups deployed on the platform. This layer is tasked with recursively aggregating proofs generated by the various rollups, all while facilitating seamless cross-rollup interoperability without the need for direct messaging via the settlement layer.

We will be integrating with Polygon Agg layer to serve as the aggregation layer for Fractal. You can read more about Polygon's Agg layer in their blog [here](https://polygon.technology/blog/aggregated-blockchains-a-new-thesis).

At its core, the aggregation layer sources and aggregate zero-knowledge proofs associated with rollup blocks. One of the most significant advantages of the aggregation layer's functionality lies in its ability to achieve substantial economic savings during the settlement process, particularly when settling to the Ethereum blockchain. In addition the aggregation layer also offers safety gurantees for cross-rollup transactions.
