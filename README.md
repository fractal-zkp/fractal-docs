# Introduction

### What is Fractal?

Fractal represents the next evolutionary step in scalable blockchain solutions, offering a sophisticated yet user-friendly decentralized shared validity sequencer. Designed to streamline the deployment of zero-knowledge rollups, Fractal removes traditional barriers to entry with its full-stack approach.

Central to the Fractal platform is the Fractal hub, a pioneering protocol powered by a decentralized ensemble of sequencers, validators, provers. By interacting with the Fractal hub, users can effortlessly commission the sequencing of rollups. Upon receiving a rollup sequencing request, the network's coordinated fleet of operators collaboratively cater to the specifications, manifesting a seamless, no-code sequencer set deployment.

Fractal tackles the challenges of interoperability in a multi-rollup architecture through its native shared validity sequencer, seamlessly integrated within its validity and sequencer layers. This innovative design facilitates atomic cross rollup transactions, culminating in an interoperability experience akin to a unified execution environment.

One of the distinct advantages of the Fractal platform is its employment of zero-knowledge cryptography. This commitment not only fortifies security but also optimizes the settlement process, leveraging the innovative power of recursive proofs to achieve amortised settlement costs across all rollups on the platform.
