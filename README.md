# Introduction

### What is Fractal?

Fractal represents the next evolutionary step in scalable blockchain solutions, offering a sophisticated yet user-friendly decentralized rollup-as-a-service provider. Designed to streamline the deployment of zero-knowledge rollups, Fractal removes traditional barriers to entry with its full-stack approach.

Central to the Fractal platform is the Fractal hub, a pioneering protocol powered by a decentralized ensemble of sequencers, validators, provers and aggregation layer. By interacting with the Fractal hub, users can effortlessly commission the creation of rollups. Upon receiving a rollup deployment request, the network's coordinated fleet of operators collaboratively cater to the specifications, manifesting a seamless, no-code rollup deployment.

One of the distinct advantages of the Fractal platform is its employment of zero-knowledge cryptography. This commitment not only fortifies security but also optimizes the settlement process, leveraging the innovative power of recursive proofs to achieve amortised settlement costs across all rollups on the platform.
