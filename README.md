# Introduction

### What is Fractal?

Fractal is a shared validity sequencer. Our mission is to democratize access to scalable, secure, and interoperable ZK-rollups, complete with liquidity and users. We're tackling the challenges of rollup fragmentation, slow time to finality, and centralization head-on.

With our shared validity sequencer and integration with the Polygon Aggregation Layer, Fractal offers dedicated chains with a unified experience. This means users benefit from a cohesive ecosystem of rollups that offers the UX of a single-chain, while enjoying the reliability and security of a decentralized network. Our unique approach ensures fast time to finality, thanks to the swift and reliable block validation provided by the Fractal Hub. Additionally, we go beyond transaction inclusion guarantees by offering transaction execution, enabling cross-rollup atomic interoperability. We also support modular customization across certain dimensions, such as choosing alternative DA solutions.
