# Deploy

### Overview

The **Deploy** page of the Fractal Web Portal is a streamlined, user-friendly interface designed to guide users through the process of configuring and deploying rollups on the Fractal network. This section of the documentation will walk you through each step of the deployment process, ensuring you have all the information needed to successfully launch your rollup.  Rollups deployed on testnet will be automatically destroyed after 2 hours. A user can only have 1 rollup deployed at any time.
